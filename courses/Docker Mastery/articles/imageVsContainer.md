# Image vs. Container

To summarize, an image is a static package that contains everything needed to run an application, while a container is a running instance of an image that provides an isolated and lightweight execution environment. Containers allow for efficient resource utilization, easy deployment, and consistent behavior across different environments, making them popular for application deployment and scaling.

## To Summarize
- An Image is the application we want to run
- A Container is an instance of that image running as a process
- You can have many containers running off the same image
